## Description
This solution helps make better use of the data collected in EUROSAI’s database of audit reports, which is administered by the Czech SAI. By providing visualizations, it enables users to see the data in a more analytical way and efficiently get an overview of the data. The end goal is to include these visualization options on the EUROSAI website.

For EUROSAI, this will offer insights into emerging trends in auditing, for example which topics have recently received more attention and where there could be potential for cooperation.  It will also help get a quick overview of how active different countries are in contributing to the database.

Auditors and other SAI professionals will be able to see which countries have worked most with certain topics they are interested in and could provide useful information, and which topics are covered less by their own SAI.
The solution also aims to increase the use of the database and encourage SAIs to contribute to it.
